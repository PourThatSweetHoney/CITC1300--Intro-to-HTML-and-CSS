                <h3>How Gene Therapy Works</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Gene therapy is a medical technique that involves introducing genetic material into cells to treat or prevent disease.  This approach is particularly promising for conditions caused by genetic defects, as it can potentially correct the underlying problem.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; There are several methods of delivering genetic material. One common method uses viral vectors, such as harmless viruses, to transport the therapeutic gene into target cells. These viruses have been modified to remove their disease-causing properties and instead carry the desired gene. Another approach involves using non-viral methods, like lipid nanoparticles, to encapsulate the gene and deliver it to cells.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; inside the target cells, the therapeutic gene integrates into the cell's DNA, allowing it to produce the missing or faulty protein. This can restore normal function and alleviate the symptoms of the disease.

                <h3>Success Story Of Gene Therapy</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;The video to the right describes a clinical trial at Nationwide Children's Hospital for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1, a devastating genetic disease that robs babies of their ability to move, talk, swallow, and eventually breathe. A large percentage of patients die before one year of age, and 95% are gone by age 2.
                    <br />
                    &emsp;The trial involved a one-time injection of gene therapy that replaces the missing SMN gene in babies with SMA. This gene is vital for development. For Evelyn, the gene therapy worked. She started seeing changes as little as two months after treatment. She started to get more active, holding her head up. A little after 3-4 months, she rolled over on her own. Now, 3-year-old Evelyn challenges Dr. Mendell to a dance-off at her annual follow-up appointment.

                <h3>Gene Therapy at Home: Curing Lactose Intolerance</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;Lactose intolerance,the inability to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk and dairy products, affects millions of people worldwide. While dietary adjustments are typically the primary treatment, gene therapy offers a potentially more permanent solution.
                    <br />
                    &emsp;Gene therapy for lactose intolerance aims to introduce a functional copy of the LCT gene, which codes for lactase, the enzyme necessary to break down lactose. This can be achieved through various methods, including viral vectors or non-viral delivery systems. By delivering the LCT gene to the cells lining the small intestine, where lactose digestion occurs, gene therapy could potentially restore the ability to digest lactose, allowing individuals to consume dairy products without experiencing symptoms like bloating, gas, or diarrhea.
