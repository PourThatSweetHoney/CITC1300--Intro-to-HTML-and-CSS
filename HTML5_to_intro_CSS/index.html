                <h1>Napoleon's Early Life</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>Napoleon was born in Corsica, a small island south of France in 1769.  In 1779 he left this small island to mainland France and joined the French Royal Army, eventually being comissioned as an officer in 1785.  In 1789 he supported the French Revolution and was quickly placed in command of the French army in the battle of Toulons, thus changing the course of history forever. </p>
