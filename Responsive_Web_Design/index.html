                    <h1>Napoleon's Military Genious</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        &emsp; Napoleon Boneparte (1769-1821) is one of the greatest military commanders in human history.  His accomplishments are well regarded amongst military historians.  From a lowly artillery officer serving the French Republic  to the Emperor of France and conqueror of Europe, his campaigns still ripple throughout the world.  A masterful tactician and brilliant strategist, he served in over 80 battles in his career and only lost 10.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; His ability to manuver, surprise, and decisivley defeat the enemy being outnumbered and out gunned shows his military brilliance.  His conquest of most of Europe in 10 years shows the sheer brilliance of his command.  Unfortunately, his hubris got the best of him, and in 1812 he began the disasterous campaign to invade Russia.  His defeat there, along with his failed invasion of Spain, and continued Brittish harassment emboldened the other nations of Europe to unite and crush him.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; After his defeat, he was exiled to the island of Elba.  Not content with living the rest of his days in exile, he came back to France, overthrew the king, and began one final campaign to protect his reign.  The battle that came out of this echoes to this day: "Waterloo", Napoleon's gretest defeat.

                    <h1>Napoleon's Early Successes</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        &emsp; Napoleon was born in Corsica, a small island south of France in 1769.  In 1779 he left this small island to mainland France and joined the French Royal Army, eventually being comissioned as an officer in 1785.  In 1789 he supported the French Revolution and was quickly placed in command of the French army in the battle of Toulons, thus changing the course of history forever.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; The city of Toulons was one of France's most important port cities, a center for French naval power in the region.  The persecutions of the French Revolution and the invasion of France on all sides by her enemies had convinced the inhabitants to go into open rebellion and even allowed a Brittish fleet in the harbor.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; Most of France's officer corps prior to the revolution were aristocrats, due to the shortage and his support of the revolution, Napoleon was chosen to lead the French army at Toulons.  He decisively defeated the British troops protecting the mouth of the harbor, and forced the British navy to leave port and allowed the French to capture the city.  The victory here would be a shadow of what would come of this young artillery officer and made him popular amongst the French Republic.

                    <h1>Napoleon's First Campaign</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;2 years after his victory at Toulons, Napoleon is put in command of the French army in Italy.  The Republic at the time was teetering on disaster as France was invaded on all sides by her enemies and counter revolutionaries threaten to collapse the nation.  However, the hardcore revolutionaries in France have been replaced with the more moderate Directorate, and due to the successful invasion of the low countries, the Prussians and Spanish have left the war against France.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;The French army was beginning a new major campaign against Austria, sending two armies north across Germany to invade Austria, and a secondary minor push into Italy.  That is where Napoleon is sent.  Italy was not considered a major front and was in dissarray.  Unsupplied, unpaid, and lacking weapons and ammunition, Napoleon transformed the Army of Italy into a formitable fighting force.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;Outnumbered and outgunned, Napoleon demonstrated his military genious and on a secondary under supplied front managed to conquer all of Northern Italy in less than two months.  He divided Austria and the kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and conquered thier armies in detail, winning a victory that astonished the people of France.
