    <h1>About Napoleon Boneparte</h1>
    <h3>"There is no more useless labour than to point out that Bonaparte was an excellent man. He is in no wise wicked as this word is understood in common life. He has too much practical understanding for that. He is a very strong man, and in the different setting of another age, he would have become a very great man." - Klemens von Metternich</h3>
    <p>Napoleon Boneparte is one of the best military commanders in human history.  For his 20 year career as a military commander starting in Toulons in 1793 and ending in Waterloo in 1815 he served in over 80 battles and only lost 10.  His stunning military career which allowed him to conquer most of Europe is still studied in military colleges and historians alike. </p>
